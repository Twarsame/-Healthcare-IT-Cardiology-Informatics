Healthcare IT Cardiology Informatics Consultant Readiness Curriculum
Module 1: EHR Ecosystem Foundation | Lesson 1.1

📌 Overview
This lesson establishes the architectural and market foundation for understanding cardiovascular information systems (CVIS) within modern healthcare IT environments. Through systematic analysis of vendor positioning, standards frameworks, and integration patterns, you'll develop the consultant's mental model for assessing any cardiology IT environment.
Learning Outcome: Move from "which system is better" thinking to contextual architectural assessment—the cornerstone of consulting expertise.

🎯 What You'll Learn
Core Concepts

CVIS fundamental distinction: Data-centric integration philosophy vs. image-focused PACS
Three-tier architecture model: Enterprise EHR → Department CVIS → Modality devices
Market landscape: Epic Cupid dominance, Cerner challenges, hybrid architecture patterns
Standards ecosystem: HL7, DICOM, IHE as interoperability tools (not just compliance)
Consultant assessment frameworks: Diagnostic questions for organizational readiness evaluation

📚 Core Architecture Concepts
Concept 1: CVIS Data Integration Philosophy
The Fundamental Distinction
PACS (Radiology)              CVIS (Cardiology)
├─ Image storage              ├─ Image storage
├─ Image visualization        ├─ Measurement data
└─ Report management          ├─ Waveform data
                              ├─ Clinical context
                              ├─ Longitudinal comparison
                              ├─ Automated decision support
                              └─ Registry reporting

Key Difference: Cardiology emphasizes DATA FUSION over pure imaging
Clinical Reality Example:
An echo cardiologist needs:

Ultrasound images ✓
Ejection fraction (numeric)
Chamber dimensions (structured)
Valve assessment (coded observations)
Prior study comparison (longitudinal data)
HF diagnosis correlation (EHR integration)
CDS alert if EF ≤35% (automated insight)

A radiologist needs:

CT/MRI images ✓
Report availability ✓

Consultant Insight: Epic Cupid's limitations aren't technical failures—they reflect Epic's core strength as enterprise system, not specialty data platform. This explains hybrid implementations.

Flow Understanding:

Enterprise Level initiates clinical workflow (orders in Epic)
Department Level coordinates cardiology work (CVIS manages scheduling, reporting)
Modality Level acquires clinical data (machines generate images/measurements)
Standards Layer coordinates everything (HL7/DICOM/IHE enable data movement)

Consultant Benefit: Universal mental model for assessing any cardiology IT environment. Identify gaps systematically.

Assessment Questions
Use these diagnostic questions with clients:

Clinical Complexity: "How many cath procedures/year? EP ablations? Advanced imaging?"
Enterprise Maturity: "When did you implement Epic? How mature is current implementation?"
IT Bandwidth: "Can your IT team maintain interfaces? What's your interface staffing?"
Registry Participation: "Are you required to report to NCDR? What's your data quality?"
Pain Points: "Show me current workflows—where are the manual workarounds?"

Consultant Insight: Recommendation depends on organizational context, not just technical capabilities.

## 🚀 Immediate Application

### Your First Client Engagement

**Client says:** *"We have Epic but cardiologists are frustrated with echo documentation"*

**You now know to ask:**
- Walk me through current workflow—where are manual workarounds?
- Do you use third-party CVIS or only Epic Cupid?
- What's your hemodynamic integration capability?
- Are you meeting ACC/AHA 2014 structured reporting standards?
- What's your NCDR registry data quality?

**This diagnostic approach distinguishes consultants from implementers.**

---

## 📊 Knowledge Check

<details>
<summary><b>Question 1:</b> What differentiates CVIS from PACS?</summary>

**Answer:** CVIS emphasizes data integration (measurements, waveforms, clinical context) while PACS prioritizes image visualization. Cardiology's defining characteristic is merging diverse data types where "images are important but play second fiddle" (McKenzie & Kapitula, 2015).

**Consultant Implication:** Epic Cupid design reflects this—enterprise system, not specialty data platform.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 2:</b> Name three IHE standards and their cardiology purpose.</summary>

**Answer:**
- **DICOM MWL:** Auto-populates patient demographics on modality
- **DICOM MPPS:** Reports procedure status back to CVIS
- **DICOM SR:** Encodes measurements in standardized format for interoperability

**Consultant Implication:** These eliminate manual entry, enable automation, ensure data quality.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 3:</b> When is hybrid architecture (Epic Cupid + best-of-breed CVIS) appropriate?</summary>

**Answer:** When organization has:
- Active interventional/EP programs (justifies specialized system)
- Mature physician governance (manages complexity)
- Advanced reporting requirements (ACC/AHA 2014 compliance)
- Budget to support interfaces

**Consultant Implication:** Pragmatic choice for complex organizations; requires interface design expertise.
